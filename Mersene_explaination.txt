Mersenne Numbers

A Mersenne number is defined as a number that can be written in the form 
M base n = 2^n -1, where n is an integer. Mersenne numbers consist of all 
1s in binary numbers, which makes them binary repunits. These numbers are
 named after the French Mathematician Marin Mersenne.
 
A Mersenne prime is a Mersenne number that is also a prime number, what that 
means is that for 2^n - 1 to be a Mersenne prime, the integer n itself must 
be a prime number. For example, when n = 3, 2^3 -1 = 7, which is a prime 
number, making the result 7 a Mersenne Prime. However not ever n prime 
number of 2^n -1 is equal to a Mersenne prime number.
